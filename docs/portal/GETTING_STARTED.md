## Running Project Locally

### ðŸ“š - Getting the Repository

1. Visit the [Fuel Portal](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-portal) repo and fork the project.
2. Then clone your forked copy to your local machine and get to work.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-portal
cd fuels-portal
```

### ðŸ“¦ - Install Dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

### ðŸ“’ - Run Local Node

In this step, we are going to;

- launch a local `fuel-core` node;

```sh
pnpm node:start
```

To stop the node, run:

```sh
pnpm node:stop
```

### ðŸ’» - Run Web App

Start a local development frontend. After running the below command you can open [http://localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004) in your browser to view the frontend.

```sh
pnpm dev
```

- [packages/app](../packages/app/) Frontend application
- [packages/config](../packages/config/) Build configurations
- [docker](../docker/) Network configurations

## ðŸ§° Useful Scripts

To make life easier we added as many useful scripts as possible to our [package.json](../package.json). These are some of the most used during development:

```sh
pnpm <command name>
```

| Script           | Description                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`            | Run development server for the WebApp [packages/app](../packages/app/). |
| `services:stop`  | Stop and remove all development containers that are running locally.    |
| `services:start` | Run the local network with `fuel-core` and the `faucet` API.            |

> Other scripts can be found in [package.json](../package.json).

## Run Tests

To run all tests against the node and contract configured in `packages/app/.env` (or `packages/app/.env.test` if the file exists):

```sh
pnpm test
```
