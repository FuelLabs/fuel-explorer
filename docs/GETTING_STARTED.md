# Getting Started

## Requirements

This project includes both frontend and contracts. To begin, install dependencies:

- [Node.js v20.11.0 or latest stable](https://nodejs.org/en/). We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install.
- [PNPM v8.15.7 or latest stable](https://pnpm.io/installation/)
- [Docker v25.0.3 or latest stable](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose v2.24.6 or latest stable](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Rust v1.76.0 or latest `stable`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Forc v0.49.3 with latest toolchain](https://install.fuel.network/latest)

## Running Project Locally

### ðŸ“š 1. Getting the Repository

1. Visit the [Fuel Explorer](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-explorer) repo and fork the project.
2. Then clone your forked copy to your local machine and get to work.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-explorer
cd fuel-explorer
```

### ðŸ“¦ 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

### ðŸ“’ 3. Run Local Node

This command will start essential development services;

- `L1` local node (to handle ethereum blockchain);
- `Fuel` local node (to handle L2 chain);
- `Postgres` database (that we use to index data); 

```
pnpm node:start
```

> You can check more details in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-explorer/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml) file.

### ðŸ’» 4. Run Web App

Now that you have the local node running, you can start the frontend.

1. Create a `.env` file based on the provided example in the `packages/app-explorer` directory

```sh
cp packages/app-explorer/.env.example packages/app-explorer/.env
```

2. Start the frontend with the following command:

```sh
pnpm dev
``` 

After running that command, you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the explorer working.

## ðŸ§ª Run E2E tests

1. Use the following command to install `Playwright` along with its dependencies, including `Chromium` 

```sh
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

2. Create a `.env` file based on the provided example in the `packages/graphql` directory

```sh
cp packages/graphql/.env.example packages/graphql/.env
```

3. Start local node server

```sh
pnpm node:start
```

4. Finally, you can run the E2E tests with the following command:

```sh
pnpm test:e2e
```

## ðŸ§° Useful Scripts

To make life easier we added as many useful scripts as possible to our [package.json](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-explorer/blob/main/package.json). 
These are some of the most used during development:

```sh
pnpm <command name>
```

| Script         | Description                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`          | Run the development server (frontend only)                           |
| `node:start`   | Run the local network with `fuel-core` and the `faucet` API.         |
| `node:stop`    | Stop all containers without removing data                            |
| `node:clean`   | Stop and remove all development containers that are running locally. |
| `node:restart` | Restart all containers without removing data                         |
| `test:e2e`     | Run the E2E tests                                                   |
| `ts:check`     | Run the TypeScript compiler                                          |
