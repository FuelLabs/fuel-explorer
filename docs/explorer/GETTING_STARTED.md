## ðŸ§° Useful Scripts

To make life easier we added as many useful scripts as possible to our [package.json](../package.json). These are some of the most used during development:

```sh
pnpm <command name>
```

| Script         | Description                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node:start`   | Run the local network with `fuel-core` and the `faucet` API.         |
| `node:stop`    | Stop all containers without removing data                            |
| `node:clean`   | Stop and remove all development containers that are running locally. |
| `node:restart` | Restart all containers without removing data                         |

> Other scripts can be found in [package.json](../package.json).
